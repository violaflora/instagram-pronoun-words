# About
Instagram allows you to put between 1-4 pronouns next to your name. I thought it would be fun to see what english words you can create from their list of 40 possible pronouns.

## Word List

## Usage
1. put a dictionary named 'words_alpha.txt' in the root folder, e.g., https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
2. `python pronouns_to_words.py >> output.txt`
